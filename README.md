# UCI-CSE142-Compilers-Interpreters
Quarter-long compiler design for CSE142 at UC Irvine

Winter quarter of 2016. Compiler was developed over the span of 10 weeks. Class taught by Professor Harry Xu.

Compiler was designed to compile a simple non-object-oriented language created by the professor. The compiler goes through all the common phases: Lexical Analysis > Syntax Analysis > Semantic Analysis > IR Generation > IR Optimization > Code Generation > Optimization. 
Once this compiler is done running, the output is a MIPS (asembly) file. This file can then be run on a MIPS compiler and the program will execute.
